# parallel-programming
project to get a better view on paralell programming

I'll be taking a look on the effectiveness of the saito-toriwaki algorithm for computing euclidean distances in binary images in the context of sequential and parallel code

I also pretend to build a script to make an analysis of it

The code is compiled with gcc. Do not forget to add the -fopenmp flag to test the parallel programming alg
