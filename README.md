# parallel-programming
project to get a better view on paralell programming

I'll be taking a look on the effectiveness of the saito-toriwaki algorithm for computing euclidean distances in binary images in the context of sequential and parallel code

I also pretend built a script to plot some statistics about the code

The code is compiled with gcc. Do not forget to add the -fopenmp flag to test the parallel programming algorithm. It's also good to use the -O3 flag

Feito para a matéria de organização de computadores na faculdade
